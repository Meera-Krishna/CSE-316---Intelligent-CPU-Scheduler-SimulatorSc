1.	Project Overview
Introduction
The Intelligent CPU Scheduler Simulator is a dynamic and interactive tool designed to simulate various 
CPU scheduling algorithms, including FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, and Priority Scheduling. It provides
real-time visualizations and performance metrics to help users understand and analyze scheduling 
techniques effectively. Unlike traditional scheduling demonstrations, this simulator offers an 
intuitive interface that allows users to input processes with arrival times, burst times, and
priorities while dynamically generating Gantt charts along with along with performance metrics
like Average Waiting Time (AWT) and Turnaround Time (TAT).
Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop an easy-to-use, intelligent CPU scheduling simulator
that helps students, researchers, and professionals visualize how different scheduling algorithms
work in real-time. This tool will assist in understanding scheduling efficiency by computing performance
metrics such as average waiting time, turnaround time, and CPU utilization.
